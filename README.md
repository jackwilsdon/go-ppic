Profile picture generation service written in Go. A demo can be found at [ppic.now.sh](https://ppic.now.sh/hello).

`go-ppic` provides two commands; [`ppic`](#ppic) and [`ppicd`](#ppicd).

## ppic

`ppic` is used to generate profile pictures on the command line, without having to run a web server. `ppic` outputs the generated image to stdout.

### Installation

```Shell
go get -u github.com/jackwilsdon/go-ppic/cmd/ppic
```

### Usage

```Text
usage: ppic username [size] > image.png
```

> `size` defaults to 512 if not provided

### Examples

```Shell
ppic jackwilsdon 1024 > profile.png
```

## ppicd

`ppicd` is a web server providing image generation.

### Installation

```Shell
go get -u github.com/jackwilsdon/go-ppic/cmd/ppicd
```

### Usage

```Shell
ppicd
```

There are a number of environment variables that can be set to change how `ppicd` operates.

| Name    | Description                                                                                  | Value      | Default |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------|
| `DEBUG` | Whether or not the [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/) routes should be enabled. | `0` or `1` | `0`     |
| `GZIP`  | Whether or not responses should be gzipped.                                                  | `0` or `1` | `1`     |
| `PORT`  | The port to run the server on.                                                               | Number     | `3000`  |

Once the server is running, you can retrieve an image by visiting `http://localhost:3000/image.png` (provided you haven't changed `PORT`). Other supported file extensions are `.gif` and `.jpeg`, defaulting to `.png` if there is no file extension in the URL.

You can change the size of images which are generated by adding `?size=1024` to the end of the URL.

## Limitations

Here is a list of known limitations (subject to change);

* Image size must be a multiple of 8
